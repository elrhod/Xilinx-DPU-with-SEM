* "However, while the PS and PCAP are in control of the configuration logic, the PL and ICAP
* are locked out of the configuration logic. For the SEM controller to function, configuration
* logic access must be transferred to the ICAP. This is accomplished by clearing the pcap_pr
* (Bit[0]) in the PS CSU pcap_ctrl register (pcap_ctrl, address 0xFFCA3008). To confirm
* that the SEM controller has access to the configuration logic, ICAP_AVAIL can be monitored.
* If ICAP_AVAIL = 0, a higher priority master such as MCAP, PCAP, or JTAG has control of the
* configuration logic. If ICAP_AVAIL = 1, the SEM controller has access to the configuration"
